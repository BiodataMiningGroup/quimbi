Quick exploration tool for multivariate bioimages

## Set up

To run the project you need `node`, `npm` and `grunt` installed. Clone this repository, run `npm install` and then `grunt build` to build the project.

For developement you can use `grunt watch` to build changed files on the fly.

To start the tool, run `build/index.html`. To actually use it, you need a dataset in `build/data/` but this isn't included in this repository.
