# QUIMBI Roadmap


## Issues

- Make "reset" broadcast for all services on any error?

- Canvas is scalable >100% and elements break if window is too small.

- Is the default tool active on startup?


## Pending features

- Permanent error messages that can be hidden via mouseclick. For this the angularmsg module has to be extended.

- Overlay image. Implemented but no sources exist!!


## Features

- Some globally visible information about the dataset (name?).

- View with further information about the dataset.

- Add feature to export the current image.
