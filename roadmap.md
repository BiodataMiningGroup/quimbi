# QUIMBI Roadmap


## Issues

- Make "reset" broadcast for all services on any error?

- Canvas is scalable >100% and elements break if window is too small.

- Is the default tool active on startup?

- Chrome: Mouse position in canvasWrapper isn't detected correctly.

- Chrome: canvasWrapper size is not saved. (related to above?)

- Chrome: Cursor style doesn't change on resize handle.

- Chrome: Settings view is broken.

- Rounding for readPixel isn't accurate. Use Math.floor()?


## Pending features

- Overlay image. Implemented but no sources exist!!


## Features
