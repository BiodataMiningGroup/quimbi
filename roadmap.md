# QUIMBI Roadmap


## Issues

- Canvas cannot be scaled down (changing width and height attributes) so the image can be rendered more efficiently.

- Initial scale of the canvas is for testing only. Has to correspond to original image and to viewport size.

- canvasWrapper resizer mustn't affect the canvasWrapper size. Otherwise the mouseposition on the canvas isn't accurate any more


## Pending features

- Changing selection by dragging of the toolPoints.

- Resizing of the canvas.

- Settings.

- Permanent error messages that can be hidden via mouseclick. For this tha angularmsg module has to be extended.

- Overlay image.


## Features

- Some globally visible information about the dataset (name?).

- View with further information about the dataset.

- Display of the color ratios in the hovered pixel.
